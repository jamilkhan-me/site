# "My 2023 annual Review"

New Year often comes with a wave of resolutions, promising ourselves a myriad of changes. Health goals, like hitting the gym regularly, are frequently at the top of the list. Yet, as the year unfolds, these aspirations often fade away. It's a common story—but it doesn't have to be mine. Therefore, I'm considering a reflective approach which might be the key to a more meaningful and successful year ahead. Reflecting on the past year might allow me to learn from experiences, recognizing what worked well and what didn't. It's like looking in the rearview mirror before steering toward the destination. I think this way: instead of setting resolutions that might fade, what if I set goals informed by a comprehensive review of the past. This can help me identify patterns, understand my strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately create a more tailored plan for the year ahead.

However, one popular approach to this reflective process is the annual review popularized by James Clear, renowned for his work on habits and personal development. Clear's method encourages a deep dive into the previous year, dissecting accomplishments, challenges, and lessons learned. Like him, I'm asking three key question to myself. 1. What went well? 2. What didn't go well? 3. What did I learn and what I am working toward?

## What went well?

#### Programming

Embarking on a journey to learn programming languages is both an exciting and daunting endeavor. It requires dedication, consistency, and a strong commitment to self-improvement. As I reflect on the past year, I'm proud to say that my determination led me through an intensive learning process that expanded my skills and knowledge in various programming languages. Learning programming languages a top priority for the year was a decision I didn't take lightly. I knew it would demand considerable time and effort, but I was prepared to embrace the challenge. Consistency became my key principle that kept me on track even when the learning curve felt steep.

During last year, I delved into various programming language such as advanced levels of JavaScript, frameworks like React JS and Next JS, exploring TypeScript, and harnessing the power of TailwindCSS. Each language brought its unique challenges and rewards, enriching my understanding of programming paradigms and expanding my toolkit as a developer. What made this ambitious journey possible was a commitment to learning, a willingness to embrace challenges, and a mindset focused on consistency. Each milestone achieved in mastering these languages fueled my motivation to keep going.

#### Book Reading:

Reading books was my enduring passion for long time. Developing a consistent reading habit was always a hectic journey for me. I attempted many times to establish a consistent reading habit but failed every time. I experimented with different approaches, purchasing physical books in hopes that their tactile presence might inspire me. I even stepped into the realm of e-reading, purchasing tablets to access a vast library of digital books. Yet, despite my efforts, the consistency I sought remained elusive. Undeterred by previous failures, I resolved to give it one last shot. I invested in a Kindle, hoping that this shift in approach might hold the key to unlocking a consistent reading habit. To my delight, this decision turned out to be a game-changer. The Kindle became more than just a device; it became a gateway to a world of literature. It's convenience, portability, and the immersive reading experience it offered transformed my perspective on reading. The barriers that once stood in the way dissolved, allowing me to delve into books effortlessly.

The result was astonishing—I've read 32 books in the span of a year. This is the first time ever I've read this many book in a year which marked a significant milestone. This newfound reading habit wasn't just about consuming stories; it was about the enrichment and fulfillment that each book brought into my life. It opened doors to knowledge, sparked imagination, and provided solace in the busiest of days.

#### Time with family:

Family is always a source of energy and motivation. Last year, I've visited my family after 9 consecutive year. I was away from home since 2008. But I never stay away for that long period. This is the longest time ever, I was away from home. During, that long span of time, I missed a lot. So many things have changed. But one thing remains unchanged the steadfast love of my mother. I spent only 12 days with family that passed in the blink of an eye. I wished if I could paused the time itself, I could have extended my visit to soak in more cherished moments.

## What didn't go well?

#### Building Projects

My intention was to create projects while learning programming languages, yet I fell short of generating a sufficient portfolio projects to showcase my skills. Looking ahead, I aspire to build more projects this year. A crucial lesson I've learned to get the most outcome from building a project. I aspire to follow a strategy when craft those projects. My plan is to replicating the same projects multiple times to augment my learning. Initially, I will construct projects by following tutorials as a foundational step. Subsequently, I will embark on the process of independently recreating these same projects to reinforce my understanding and expertise.

#### Writing:

Starting a writing endeavor is a journey often filled with aspirations, challenges, and the quest for consistency. In the last quarter of the previous year, I made a conscious decision to delve into writing, aiming to pen down my thoughts on a variety of topics every Sunday. However, despite my initial dedication, maintaining this routine proved to be a challenge. Looking forward, the upcoming year holds a renewed commitment to prioritize and nurture the habit of writing. The aspiration to amplify my focus on this craft remains at the forefront of my goals.

#### Travel:

Annually, I've explored numerous historical destinations, finding that travel enriches one's experiences. I take immense pleasure in exploring new places. To date, I've journeyed through nine countries, each trip contributing to a lifelong tapestry of experiences. However, the previous year marked an exception—I regretfully couldn't explore anywhere. Yet, this year, I'm determined to plan and embark on more travel expeditions.

## What did I learn?

Looking back, I see the immense value of reflecting my pasft year. It wasn't just about acquiring technical skills, reading books; it was about the discipline, resilience, and determination cultivated along the way. The ability to absorb new concepts and apply them practically is a testament to the dedication invested throughout the year. The takeaway from this journey is clear: consistency, dedication, and perseverance are the pillars upon which ambitious goals are achieved. It's not just about learning programming languages; it's about the journey of self-improvement and the transformative power of unwavering commitment.
