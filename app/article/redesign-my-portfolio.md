# Redesign my portfolio Version 3.0

Hey there! Welcome to my very first blog post on my new portfolio. You might not know, but this is actually my third portfolio website. Crazy, right? I've never really talked about my previous ones. Being a tech geek, I'm always on my toes, trying to keep up with the latest tech stuff. And, let's be honest, I've always felt my portfolio could be a bit more snazzy, more eye-catching, you know ðŸ˜‰?

So, let's rewind to last February. That's when I first dipped my toes into building my own portfolio. It was also when I started getting my hands dirty with programming. My first attempt? A simple, single-page website using nothing but plain HTML and CSS. Pretty basic, but hey, we all start somewhere, right?

As I kept learning, I started to get a real kick out of coding. It's kinda fun, actually! After getting the hang of JavaScript, I started looking around for what's hot in the coding world. And guess what? ReactJS was everywhere. It's like the king of frameworks! Naturally, I jumped on the React bandwagon.

But then, I had this lightbulb moment. Why not write a blog about all this? Share my journey, make it easier for others to learn from my experiences. I wanted to create a static blog, something with a solid backend to back it up. After some digging, I found the perfect fit - GatsbyJS. It works like a charm with CMS, which is just what I needed.

Long story short, I decided it was time for a makeover for my portfolio. I went with GatsbyJS that time.

But hang on, guess what happened last month? I dove headfirst into learning NextJS. It's like the hot new thing in the ReactJS world â€“ growing super fast! The best part? It's speedy and comes with server-side rendering, which is awesome for website performance and SEO. That got me thinking... why not give my portfolio another fresh look?

This time around, I didn't just stop at NextJS. I decided to spice things up with three more cool techs: Tailwindcss, Hygraph, and Vercel. They're like the cherry on top for any web project.

And voilÃ ! The portfolio you're browsing right now and this blog you're reading? That's the result of all that. Pretty cool, huh?
