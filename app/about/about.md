# About Me

Hi, I’m Jamil Khan. Currently living the good life in London, United Kingdom.

This is my personal website where I share content related to programming, technology, productivity, motivation and self-improvement.

I run a consulting business, MinorCo; we are an Asana Solutions Partner, Pipedrive Elite Partner and Zapier Premier Expert. We love helping our clients optimise their systems so they can scale and grow. In the last few years, we've helped over 1,000 one-on-one clients to create more efficient businesses.

I'm obsessed with productivity, automation, optimising my time and income so I can live on my terms. I have a variety of products where I share my productivity systems, self-improvement hacks and the process I use to find and work with consulting clients.

To keep up to date with me, you can follow me on Twitter.
